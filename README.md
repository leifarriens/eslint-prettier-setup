# eslint-prettier-setup

Quick start setup for eslint with prettier.

This repo uses `eslint` and `prettier` together with the `eslint-plugin-prettier` and `eslint-config-prettier` packages. The config is extended with `eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort` and `eslint-plugin-sort-keys-fix` for sorting import statements and object keys as auto fixable linting rules.
